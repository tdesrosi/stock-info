## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

Thank you for taking a look at the code!

I'm in the process of making a TD Ameritrade stock position updater. You'll notice that right now, all of my current positions are being held in an *array* in **app.js.** This is not at all ideal, and I'm working on integrating my data into a free mongoose database so I can more easily use TD Ameritrade to grab my stock information and update the widgets. Therefore, it's not an entire re-code and re-push just to add or remove stocks.
